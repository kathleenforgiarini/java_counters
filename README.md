# Counter and Subclasses

## Description
This is a Java project that demonstrates the use of classes and inheritance to create different types of counters. The project includes three classes: `Counter`, `StepCounter`, and `ModNCounter`, each with its unique behavior and features.

## Usage
To use this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kathleenforgiarini/java_counters.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).

3. Run the CounterTester1 class to test and demonstrate the functionality of the counter classes.

## Project Structure
- bus package contains the counter classes (Counter, StepCounter, ModNCounter).
- client package contains the CounterTester1 class to test and demonstrate the counter classes.

## Counter Classes
- Counter: The base class representing a simple counter with the ability to increment, decrement, and reset.
- StepCounter: Extends Counter and adds a step value for each increment and decrement operation.
- ModNCounter: Extends Counter and resets to a specific value (1 by default) when reaching a maximum limit.

## Example Output
You can refer to the example output in the comments section of the CounterTester1 class to see how the counters behave and their interactions.
